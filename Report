Prompt 2: Once upon a time, there was a robot who wanted to become human…”
Response: Once upon a time, there was a robot who wanted to become human. Every day, he observed people laughing, crying, and dreaming—things he couldn’t compute.
Settings: Temperature = 0.8, Max Tokens = 100

Prompt 3: Write a haiku about the ocean.”
Response: Waves crash on the shore
 Salted breeze and distant cries
 Endless blue whispers
Settings: Temperature = 0.9, Max Tokens = 30

Prompt 4: “What is a computer?”

When it came to the responses I thought each answer was pretty well made. I thought it was interesting to see how lowering the temperature made some answers like prompt one, and how increasing it changed others like prompt 2. The model performed well when explaining things to me. Like prompt 1 and 2. It struggles a little with creative topics, but not too much. I think just playing with the temperature and seeing what are the correct parameters for each question would help.
